Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI):
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially
computer systems. 
AI applications include natural language processing, machine learning, computer vision, and
robotics.
Machine Learning (ML):
Machine  Learning  is  a  subset  of  AI  that  focuses  on  developing  algorithms  that  allow  computers  to
learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.
Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are common types of ML.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):
NLP  is  a  field  of  AI  that  gives  machines  the  ability  to  read,  understand,  and  derive  meaning  from
human languages. Applications include chatbots, translation, and sentiment analysis.
Robotics:
Robotics  integrates  AI  to  create  intelligent  machines  that  can  perform  tasks  in  the  real  world,  from
industrial automation to healthcare assistance.
